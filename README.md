BUGGY PINBALL PROJECT

functions.py contains all optimization problems implemented so far.
For 3D representation of buggy pinball the variant_tr3_4.py file can be used within TA variants folder.

Algorithms implemented and ready for multiple iterations and storage of results:

- Simulated Annealing (SA.py)

- Threshold Accepting (TA.py)

- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO.py)

-Buggy Pinball (BP.py)
