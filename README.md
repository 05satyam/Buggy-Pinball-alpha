SIMULATED ANNEALING PROJECT

functions.py contains all optimization problems implemented so far.
For 3D representation of optimization functions use test.py code.

Versions of TA variants implemented:

N = neighborhood linear decay

Tl = threshold logarithmic decay

Tc = threshold cosine decay

Te = threshold exponential decay

tr = trajectory search

tr2 = new trajectory search (line-function intersection)

tr3 = stepwise trajectory search (with z dimension descent and line-function intersection)

grid = search n points, go to the best, and continue with TA
